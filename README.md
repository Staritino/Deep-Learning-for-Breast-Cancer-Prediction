Machine learning algorithms for breast cancer prediction - A deep learning approach

Breast Cancer is the most deadly and commonly diagnosed cancer in women globally. Early diagno-
sis and treatment of breast cancer increases the chance of a five-year survival rate by 99%. Recent
technological and computational advancement have led to the discovery of machine learning algorithms
for the analysis of complex data. Machine learning algorithms have been applied for the analysis of
breast cancer data. In this essay, we propose to implement machine learning algorithms, using a deep
learning approach, for automatic detection and prediction of breast cancer in mammogram images. To
achieve this, we implement transfer learning on a deep learning algorithm called Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN). Datasets of breast cancer images were analyzed using three CNN models in existing
deep learning frameworks. The models performed a binary and multi-classification task on the images.
The experimental results showed that CNN models can accurately identify and predict breast cancer
when provided with a large and balanced dataset
